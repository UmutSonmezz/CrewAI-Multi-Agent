# Multi-Agent HTML Enhancement System using CrewAI
In this project, I developed a Multi-Agent System using CrewAI Agents to address and resolve HTML issues that enhance a website's performance. I designed specific prompts for the agents to identify and fix HTML errors that could be optimized for better functionality. By inputting error reports from a website analysis tool, the agents suggest appropriate HTML code corrections and provide examples of how to implement these corrections effectively.

To search for relevant results from Google and other search engines, I utilized the Serper API key. For generating outputs and employing creative AI, I used the Gemini-1.5-Flash model via ChatGoogleGenerativeAI. This system not only identifies and suggests fixes for HTML errors but also ensures that the solutions are practical and easy to implement.

Technologies Used:
CrewAI Agents for Multi-Agent System,
Custom Prompts for HTML error resolution and optimization,
Serper API for searching results from Google and other search engines,
Gemini-1.5-Flash Model via ChatGoogleGenerativeAI for creative AI responses.
